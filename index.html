            <p>Hello and welcome to my Web Developer Portfolio.  I am a beginner coder and currently
                studying through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.  As a web
                developer, my goal is being able to create websites and mobile applications for 
                millions of users and be employeed at major tech company, such as Google inc.
            <br>
            <br>
                What am I currently doing now?  Today, I am an Active Duty member of the 
                <a href="https://www.uscg.mil" target="_blank">United States Coast Guard</a> (Semper Paratus!).  
                My rating is called Yeoman and 
                I provide administrative support to Coast Guard members, such as pay and persoonel.
                As I have 13 years of Active Duty, that gives me seven years to build up my 
                web developer skills and start the next phase of my life.   
            <br>
